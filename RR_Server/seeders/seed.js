    title: "Restoring Your First Game Boy (DMG-01)",
    description: "A comprehensive guide to cleaning, repairing, and modding the original Nintendo Game Boy.",
    content: `
      ## Introduction to Game Boy Restoration
      The Nintendo Game Boy (DMG-01) is an icon. Bringing one back to life is a rewarding experience. This guide covers basic cleaning to more advanced mods.

      ## Tools You'll Need
      * Tri-wing screwdriver
      * Small Phillips head screwdriver
      * Isopropyl alcohol (90%+)
      * Cotton swabs, soft brush, microfiber cloths
      * Soldering iron (for advanced mods)
      * Desoldering braid/pump
      * New screen (IPS mod, optional)
      * New capacitors (if recapping)

      ## Step 1: Disassembly
      1.  Remove batteries and battery cover.
      2.  Unscrew the six tri-wing screws on the back.
      3.  Carefully separate the front and back shells. Be gentle with the ribbon cable.
      4.  Disconnect the ribbon cable by flipping up its connector lock.
      5.  Remove the main PCB (Printed Circuit Board) by unscrewing any Phillips screws holding it.

      ## Step 2: Cleaning the PCB
      Clean any corrosion, especially around battery terminals and power switch, using isopropyl alcohol and a brush/cotton swab.

      ## Step 3: Screen Cleaning (Optional & Delicate)
      If dust is under the screen, you may need to carefully separate the LCD from the front housing. Clean with a microfiber cloth.

      ## Step 4: Recapping (Advanced)
      Old capacitors can leak and cause issues. Desolder old caps and replace with new ones of the correct rating.

      ## Step 5: IPS Screen Mod (Advanced)
      Replace the original screen with a vibrant IPS display for a modern look. This involves soldering and shell modification.

      ## Reassembly
      Reverse the steps. Test functionality before fully securing the case.

    content: `
      ## What is DOSBox?
      DOSBox is an emulator that recreates a DOS environment, allowing you to run old DOS games and applications that won't work natively on modern operating systems.

      ## Installation
      1.  Download DOSBox from the official website ([www.dosbox.com](http://www.dosbox.com/)).
      2.  Run the installer and follow the prompts.

      ## Basic Configuration
      The most important step is 'mounting' your game directory as a drive.
      For example, if your games are in 'C:\\DOSGames':
      \`\`\`bash
      mount c C:\\DOSGames
      c:
      dir
      \`\`\`
      Then navigate to your game's directory and run its executable (e.g., \`cd wolf3d\` then \`wolf3d.exe\`).

      ## Advanced Settings
      Edit the \`dosbox.conf\` file for full-screen mode, specific CPU cycles, sound emulation, etc.

    content: `
      ## Why Proper Vinyl Care Matters
      Vinyl records can last for decades if cared for properly. Dust, dirt, and improper handling are their biggest enemies, leading to surface noise and degradation.

      ## Cleaning Your Records
      * **Dry Cleaning:** Use a carbon fiber brush before each play to remove surface dust.
      * **Wet Cleaning:** For deeper cleaning, use a specialized vinyl record cleaning solution and a microfiber cloth. Apply solution sparingly and wipe in the direction of the grooves.
      * **Record Cleaning Machines:** For serious collectors, vacuum-based record cleaning machines offer the best results.

      ## Storage
      * Store records vertically in poly-lined inner sleeves and sturdy outer sleeves.
      * Avoid stacking records horizontally, which can cause warping.
      * Keep records away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and high humidity.

      ## Handling
      Always handle records by the edges or the label. Avoid touching the grooves directly with your fingers.

      ## Commodore 64 Motherboard Components
      This guide provides a high-level overview of the Commodore 64 motherboard's key components and their interconnections, as found in common schematics.

      ## Key Chips
      * **MOS 6510:** CPU
      * **MOS 6567/6569 (VIC-II):** Video Interface Chip
      * **MOS 6581/8580 (SID):** Sound Interface Device
      * **MOS 6526 (CIA):** Complex Interface Adapter (x2)
      * **ROM Chips:** Kernal, Basic, Character ROMs

      ## Power Distribution
      The 9VAC and 5VDC from the power supply are distributed across the board. Pay attention to filtering capacitors near power inputs.

      ## Data Bus
      The 8-bit data bus connects most chips. Understanding its flow is key for diagnostics.

    title: "Basic Repair: Replacing a Console Power Adapter",
    description: "How to safely identify and replace a faulty power adapter for retro gaming consoles.",
    content: `
      ## Introduction
      Many retro consoles suffer from worn-out or lost power adapters. Replacing them is often straightforward, but requires attention to detail to avoid damaging your console.

      ## Identifying the Correct Adapter
      **Crucial Information:**
      1.  **Voltage (V):** Must match exactly (e.g., 9V, 12V).
      2.  **Amperage (A / mA):** Must meet or *exceed* the original (e.g., 850mA, 1A). Never use one with lower amperage.
      3.  **Polarity (Center Positive/Negative):** **MOST CRITICAL.** Incorrect polarity can instantly destroy your console. Check the symbol on the console or original adapter (circle with dot in middle, plus/minus signs).
      4.  **Plug Type:** Ensure the physical barrel plug fits.

      ## Where to Buy
      Look for reputable retro gaming suppliers or specialized electronics stores. Avoid generic "universal" adapters unless they explicitly list compatibility and allow you to set correct voltage/polarity.

      ## Safety First
      Always unplug both the console and the adapter from the wall outlet before connecting/disconnecting.
